 I tried opening the jpeg as an image, it displayed a cat.
 running 'file cat.jpeg' gave me nothing interesting

 then I ran 'xxd cat.jpeg' and at the beginning there was some mentions at PicoCTF.
 so I ran 'head cat.jpeg' and it gave me this:

 I tried using both the id and resource as flags and wasn't successful

 so I googled about rdf and cc but they led me to nothing, so I just googled what I was supposed to do and it turns out I was supposed to decode the resource as base64.

 so decoding it gives me picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}

 I guess if I haven't googled it, probably wouldn't have guessed it myself.
 maybe I should approach other challenges using base64 as an alternative/option
