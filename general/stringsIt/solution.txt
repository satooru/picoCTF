After I downloaded the file, I tried to open it on the ubuntu text editor, and to my surprise it crashed LOL

Then I tried to see what would happen if I cat this file and it outputs too much stuff and some understandable stuff here and there

So I ran a hexdump on the file (out is the output from hexdump -C) and searched for 'pico'.

Another cool thing is that in the beggining of the hexdump, there is a hint
"Maybe try the 'strings' function? Take a look at the man page"

then I also ran 'strings strings | grep pico' and it gave me the following output
picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_d66c7bb7}
